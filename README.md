# Start_up_PV_system_microconverters_PLECS
This repository includes a PLECS simulation model where the main micro-converter control concepts proposed in "Callegaro, L.; Uong, T.-H.; Deilami, S.; Seamless Start-Up of a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System Using Module-Integrated Micro-Converters, Energies, 2023" are implemented. The purpose fullfilled is to achieve a seamless start-up of a grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) power system where a micro-converter is embedded in every PV module.
